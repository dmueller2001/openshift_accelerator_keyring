# OpenShift Accelerator Keyring

3D printer shape files and gcode for the [OpenShift Accelerator](http://origin.openshift.com/accelerators) keyring.

Handy for meetup swag and impressing your friends with your OpenShift badassness.

## Formats

Format | Use
------ | ----
.stl   | STereoLithography open file standard, you probably want this one
.obj   | 3D object file, also good
.fcstd | FreeCAD native file format
.gcode | Printer-specific instructions, refer to filename

## Prototype

Here's a prototype print-run. The production keyrings will be red, just like the logo.
